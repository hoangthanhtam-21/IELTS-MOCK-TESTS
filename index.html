            content: `
              <p><span id="s1">In 2016, the British professional tennis player Andy Murray was ranked as the world’s number one.</span> <span id="s2">It was an incredible achievement by any standard...</span> <span id="s3">Yet five years previously, he had been regarded as a talented outsider who entered but never won the major tournaments.</span></p>
              <p><span id="s4">Of the changes that account for this transformation, one was visible and widely publicised: in 2011, Murray invited former number one player Ivan Lendl onto his coaching team...</span> <span id="s5">Another change was so subtle as to pass more or less unnoticed.</span> <span id="s6">Murray has long preferred a racket that consists of two types of string: one for the mains (verticals) and another for the crosses (horizontals).</span> <span id="s7">While he continued to use natural string in the crosses, in 2012 he switched to a synthetic string for the mains.</span></p>
              <p><span id="s10">‘Touring professionals have their rackets customised to their specific needs,’ says Colin Triplow...</span> <span id="s12">the specific rackets used by the world’s elite are not actually readily available to the public; rather, each racket is individually made to suit the player who uses it.</span> <span id="s15">They explain how they have adjusted not only racket length, but even experimented with different kinds of paint.</span> <span id="s16">The rackets they use now weigh more than the average model and also have a denser string pattern.</span></p>
              <p><span id="s19">Racket modifications mainly date back to the 1970s, when the amateur German tennis player Werner Fischer started playing with the so-called spaghetti-strung racket.</span> <span id="s20">It created a string bed that generated so much topspin that it was quickly banned.</span> <span id="s22">Today it is equal in significance to nutrition or training.</span></p>
              <p><span id="s25">Players will continually change string tension depending on factors bao gồm court surface, climatic conditions, and game styles.</span></p>
              <p><span id="s27">At one time, all tennis rackets were strung with natural gut made from the outer layer of sheep or cow intestines.</span></p>
              <p><span id="s36">Much of the serving power of US professional player Pete Sampras was attributed to the addition of four to five lead weights onto his rackets.</span></p>
              <p><span id="s40">Gonçalo Oliveira replaced the original grips of his rackets with something thinner because they had previously felt uncomfortable to hold.</span></p>
