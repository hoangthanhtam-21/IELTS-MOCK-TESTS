            title: "How tennis rackets have changed",
            content: `
              <p><span id="s1">In 2016, the British professional tennis player Andy Murray was ranked as the world’s number one.</span> <span id="s2">It was an incredible achievement by any standard – made even more remarkable by the fact that he did this during a period considered to be one of the strongest in the sport’s history, competing against the likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, to name just a few.</span> <span id="s3">Yet five years previously, he had been regarded as a talented outsider who entered but never won the major tournaments.</span></p>
              
              <p><span id="s4">Of the changes that account for this transformation, one was visible and widely publicised: in 2011, Murray invited former number one player Ivan Lendl onto his coaching team – a valuable addition that had a visible impact on the player’s playing style.</span> <span id="s5">Another change was so subtle as to pass more or less unnoticed.</span> <span id="s6">Like many players, Murray has long preferred a racket that consists of two types of string: one for the mains (verticals) and another for the crosses (horizontals).</span> <span id="s7">While he continued to use natural string in the crosses, in 2012 he switched to a synthetic string for the mains.</span> <span id="s8">A small change, perhaps, but its importance should not be underestimated.</span></p>

              <p><span id="s9">The modification that Murray made is just one of a number of options available to players looking to tweak their rackets in order to improve their games.</span> <span id="s10">‘Touring professionals have their rackets customised to their specific needs,’ says Colin Triplow, a UK-based professional racket stringer.</span> <span id="s11">‘It’s a highly important part of performance maximisation.’</span> <span id="s12">Consequently, the specific rackets used by the world’s elite are not actually readily available to the public; rather, each racket is individually made to suit the player who uses it.</span> <span id="s13">Take the US professional tennis players Mike and Bob Bryan, for example: ‘We’re very particular with our racket specifications,’ they say.</span> <span id="s14">‘All our rackets are sent from our manufacturer to Tampa, Florida, where our frames go through a … thorough customisation process.’</span> <span id="s15">They explain how they have adjusted not only racket length, but even experimented with different kinds of paint.</span> <span id="s16">The rackets they use now weigh more than the average model and also have a denser string pattern (i.e. more crosses and mains).</span></p>

              <p><span id="s17">The primary reason for these modifications is simple: as the line between winning and losing becomes thinner and thinner, even these slight changes become more and more important.</span> <span id="s18">As a result, players and their teams are becoming increasingly creative with the modifications to their rackets as they look to maximise their competitive advantage.</span></p>

              <p><span id="s19">Racket modifications mainly date back to the 1970s, when the amateur German tennis player Werner Fischer started playing with the so-called spaghetti-strung racket.</span> <span id="s20">It created a string bed that generated so much topspin that it was quickly banned by the International Tennis Federation.</span> <span id="s21">However, within a decade or two, racket modification became a regularity.</span> <span id="s22">Today it is, in many ways, an aspect of the game that is equal in significance to nutrition or training.</span></p>

              <p><span id="s23">Modifications can be divided into two categories: those to the string bed and those to the racket frame.</span> <span id="s24">The former is far more common than the latter: the choice of the strings and the tension with which they are installed is something that nearly all professional players experiment with.</span> <span id="s25">They will continually change it depending on various factors including the court surface, climatic conditions, and game styles.</span> <span id="s26">Some will even change it depending on how they feel at the time.</span></p>

              <p><span id="s27">At one time, all tennis rackets were strung with natural gut made from the outer layer of sheep or cow intestines.</span> <span id="s28">This all changed in the early 1990s with the development of synthetic strings that were cheaper and more durable.</span> <span id="s29">They are made from three materials: nylon (relatively durable and affordable), Kevlar (too stiff to be used alone) or co-polyester (polyester combined with additives that enhance its performance).</span> <span id="s30">Even so, many professional players continue to use a ‘hybrid set-up’, where a combination of both synthetic and natural strings are used.</span></p>

              <p><span id="s31">Of the synthetics, co-polyester is by far the most widely used.</span> <span id="s32">It’s a perfect fit for the style of tennis now played, where players tend to battle it out from the back of the court rather than coming to the net.</span> <span id="s33">Studies indicate that the average spin from a co-polyester string is 25% greater than that from natural string or other synthetics.</span> <span id="s34">In a sense, the development of co-polyester strings has revolutionised the game.</span></p>

              <p><span id="s35">However, many players go beyond these basic adjustments to the strings and make changes to the racket frame itself.</span> <span id="s36">For example, much of the serving power of US professional player Pete Sampras was attributed to the addition of four to five lead weights onto his rackets, and today many professionals have the weight adjusted during the manufacturing process.</span></p>

              <p><span id="s37">Other changes to the frame involve the handle.</span> <span id="s38">Players have individual preferences for the shape of the handle and some will have the handle of one racket moulded onto the frame of a different racket.</span> <span id="s39">Other players make different changes.</span> <span id="s40">The professional Portuguese player Gonçalo Oliveira replaced the original grips of his rackets with something thinner because they had previously felt uncomfortable to hold.</span></p>

              <p><span id="s41">Racket customisation and modification have pushed the standards of the game to greater levels that few could have anticipated in the days of natural strings and heavy, wooden frames, and it’s exciting to see what further developments there will be in the future.</span></p>

            content: `
              <p><strong>A.</strong> <span id="s42">The passenger pigeon was a legendary species.</span> <span id="s43">Flying in vast numbers across North America, with potentially many millions within a single flock, their migration was once one of nature’s great spectacles.</span> <span id="s44">Sadly, the passenger pigeon’s existence came to an end on 1 September 1914, when the last living specimen died at Cincinnati Zoo.</span> <span id="s45">Geneticist Ben Novak is lead researcher on an ambitious project which now aims to bring the bird back to life through a process known as ‘de-extinction’.</span> <span id="s46">The basic premise involves using cloning technology to turn the DNA of extinct animals into a fertilised embryo, which is carried by the nearest relative still in existence — in this case, the abundant band-tailed pigeon — before being born as a living, breathing animal.</span> <span id="s47">Passenger pigeons are one of the pioneering species in this field, but they are far from the only ones on which this cutting-edge technology is being trialled.</span></p>

              <p><strong>B.</strong> <span id="s48">In Australia, the thylacine, more commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, is another extinct creature which genetic scientists are striving to bring back to life.</span> <span id="s49">‘There is no carnivore now in Tasmania that fills the niche which thylacines once occupied,’ explains Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales.</span> <span id="s50">He points out that in the decades since the thylacine went extinct, there has been a spread in a ‘dangerously debilitating’ facial tumour syndrome which threatens the existence of the Tasmanian devils, the island’s other notorious resident.</span> <span id="s51">Thylacines would have prevented this spread because they would have killed significant numbers of Tasmanian devils.</span> <span id="s52">‘If that contagious cancer had popped up previously, it would have burned out in whatever region it started.’</span> <span id="s53">The return of thylacines to Tasmania could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to risks of this kind.</span></p>

              <p><strong>C.</strong> <span id="s54">If extinct species can be brought back to life, can humanity begin to correct the damage it has caused to the natural world over the past few millennia?</span> <span id="s55">‘The idea of de-extinction is that we can reverse this process, bringing species that no longer exist back to life,’ says Beth Shapiro of University of California Santa Cruz's Genomics Institute.</span> <span id="s56">‘I don’t think that we can do this.</span> <span id="s57">There is no way to bring back something that is 100 per cent identical to a species that went extinct a long time ago.’</span> <span id="s58">A more practical approach for long-extinct species is to take the DNA of existing species as a template, ready for the insertion of strands of extinct animal DNA to create something new; a hybrid, based on the living species, but which looks and/or acts like the animal which died out.</span></p>

              <p><strong>D.</strong> <span id="s59">This complicated process and questionable outcome begs the question: what is the actual point of this technology?</span> <span id="s60">‘For us, the goal has always been replacing the extinct species with a suitable replacement,’ explains Novak.</span> <span id="s61">‘When it comes to breeding, band-tailed pigeons scatter and make maybe one or two nesis per hectare, whereas passenger pigeons were very social and would make 10,000 or more nests in one hectare.’</span> <span id="s61a">Since the disappearance of this key species, ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of disturbance caused by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches means there has been minimal need for regrowth.</span> <span id="s62">This has left forests stagnant and therefore unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help regenerate the forest after a disturbance.</span> <span id="s63">According to Novak, a hybridised band-tailed pigeon, with the added nesting habits of a passenger pigeon, could, in theory, re-establish that forest disturbance, thereby creating a habitat necessary for a great many other native species to thrive.</span></p>

              <p><strong>E.</strong> <span id="s65">Another popular candidate for this technology is the woolly mammoth.</span> <span id="s66">George Church, professor at Harvard Medical School and leader of the Woolly Mammoth Revival Project, has been focusing on cold resistance, the main way in which the extinct woolly mammoth and its nearest living relative, the Asian elephant, differ.</span> <span id="s67">By pinpointing which genetic traits made it possible for mammoths to survive the icy climate of the tundra, the project's goal is to return mammoths, or a mammoth-like species, to the area.</span> <span id="s68">‘My highest priority would be preserving the endangered Asian elephant,’ says Church, ‘expanding their range to the huge ecosystem of the tundra.</span> <span id="s69">Necessary adaptations would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra insulating fat, all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra, and all traits found in the now extinct woolly mammoth.’</span> <span id="s70">This repopulation of the tundra and boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large mammals could also be a useful factor in reducing carbon emissions — elephants punch holes through snow and knock down trees, which encourages grass growth.</span> <span id="s71">This grass growth would reduce temperatures, and mitigate emissions from melting permafrost.</span></p>

              <p><strong>F.</strong> <span id="s72">While the prospect of bringing extinct animals back to life might capture imaginations, it is, of course, far easier to try to save an existing species which is merely threatened with extinction.</span> <span id="s73">‘Many of the technologies that people have in mind when they think about de-extinction can be used as a form of “genetic rescue”,’ explains Shapiro.</span> <span id="s74">She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging technology could be used to fully understand why various species went extinct in the first place, and therefore how we could use it to make genetic modifications which could prevent mass extinctions in the future.</span> <span id="s75">‘I would also say there’s an incredible moral hazard to not do anything at all,’ she continues.</span> <span id="s76">‘We know that what we are doing today is not enough, and we have to be willing to take some calculated and measured risks.’</span></p>
